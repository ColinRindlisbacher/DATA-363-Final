Here, we get the data from the csv and clean it up.
```{r}
 stateReg <- read.csv("Resources/10962-ev-registration-counts-by-state_9-06-24.csv", header=TRUE, sep =",")
 stateReg
```

Next, we create a bar plot with our counts.
```{r}
barplot(stateReg$Registration.Count/1000, 
ylab="Registration Counts (in Thousands)", names.arg = stateReg$State, las=2)
```

We see that California is a major outlier, so lets create a plot without it.
```{r}
withoutCali <- subset(stateReg, stateReg$State != "California")
withoutCali


barplot(withoutCali$Registration.Count/1000, 
ylab="Registration Counts (in Thousands)", names.arg = withoutCali$State, las=2)
```

Let's look at the data sorted by the count.
```{r}
sortedStates <- stateReg[order(stateReg$Registration.Count, decreasing = TRUE), ]
sortedStates
```

Let's look at the five number summary of our data.
```{r}
summary(stateReg)
```
